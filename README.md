- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, welcome to my profile! My name is Gabriel de NÃ³brega and I'm 21 years old.
- ðŸ“š I currently live in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. This is where I was born and raised, however I'm open to move.
- â˜• I'm studying to be a back-end developer using mostly Java. However, I'm also interested into front-end development.
- :england: I've also been studying English since I was 13 years old which makes me fluent in it. I can speak, listen and write well.
- ðŸŒ± I believe that everything is possible if you work hard and never give up!
