- 👋 Hi, welcome to my profile! My name is Gabriel de Nóbrega and I'm 21 years old.
- 📚 I currently live in São Paulo, Brazil. This is where I was born and raised, however I'm open to move.
- ☕ I'm studying at SenacSP to become a back-end developer using mostly Java. However, I'm also interested into front-end development.
- 🌎 I've also been studying English since I was 13 years old which makes me fluent in it. I can speak, listen and write well.
- 🌱 I believe that everything is possible if you work hard and never give up!
